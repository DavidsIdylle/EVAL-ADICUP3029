General description:

The ADuCM3029_demo_esp8266 project uses the EVAL-ADXL362-ARDZ shield which has an ADXL362 3-axis MEMS accelerometer and a incorporated NHD-C12832A1Z-NSW-BBW display (128Ã—32). However, for this example the display is not used.

The EVAL-ADICUP3029 is designed for IOT (Internet of Things) applications in mind, and therefore comes with on board Wi-Fi ESP8266 module.

Also, in order to fully make use of the IOT capability, MQTT messaging protocol is used as it is extremely simple and lightweight.

for details about how to create the CCES project.
